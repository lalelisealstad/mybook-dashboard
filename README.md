# Pipeline
- Use webscraping to collect the table of finalists and winners of the WPF from all years
    - manipulate table to account for merged cells
    - use regex to remove unnecessary signs in the title name
- Collect information about the book using Google Book API
    - API request for book using title and author, if not found then it checks for title with the added strin ': A novel' as I found many books had this title ending in Google Books but not in the WPF wikipedia page, then if book is not found it checks for just title 
    - Normalise string of Title to adjust for Python's case sensitivity before mergning datasett from webscraping wikipeda and google books api
- Collect topics from Open Library API and store as a JSON file
    - To make the topics easy to extract and use I store the information from the OL api as a dictionary with the Title as the Key and the list of topics as the value. 
* Store Data in BigQuery 
* Use Open Library API to get the rating, summary and tipcs. 
* Use Google Trends to get the google searches for all the books and WPF in general 
* country auther from wikipedia
* price from Google Book API
* Imput your own books into rhe dashboard - see WPF books matching in seniment, see books that are relevant from WPH using the google books api.
